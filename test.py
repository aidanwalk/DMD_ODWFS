"""
This script is developed to enable low-level control the DLPDLCR230NPEVM DMD
using a Raspberry Pi.

It allows the user to interact with the DMD (Digital Micromirror Device) to 
display various patterns on the fly. It enables critial functions for bench 
testing such as mirror locking, turning all mirrors ON or OFF, and displaying
various patterns such as checkerboard, horizontal ramp, and vertical ramp.
It also provides a simple menu interface for user interaction.

It is recommended to run this script on boot.
